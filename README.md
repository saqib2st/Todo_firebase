🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

Hey #LinkedIn community! 👋

I am thrilled to announce that I've just completed my latest project - a Todo app built with #Flutter and powered by #Firebase! 📱💨

🔥 Here are some of the awesome features I've implemented:

1️⃣ Authentication:
✅ Email login
✅ Email signup
✅ Phone OTP login/signup
✅ Continue with Google login

2️⃣ CRUD Operations:
✅ Firebase Firestore integration for seamless data management
✅ Create new tasks and store them securely
✅ Update existing tasks with ease
✅ Retrieve task data whenever needed
✅ Effortlessly delete completed tasks

3️⃣ Firebase Storage:
🖼️ Upload and store images
📁 Support for other file uploads as well

I am grateful for the valuable experience gained while working on this project. 😊 It allowed me to strengthen my skills in Flutter development, Firebase integration, and implementing various authentication methods. 🛠️📚

The journey was both challenging and rewarding. I encountered and overcame obstacles, learned new techniques, and improved my problem-solving abilities. 🚧🎯

A big shoutout to the amazing Flutter community and the comprehensive Firebase documentation - both of which were instrumental in bringing this project to life. 🙌📖

Feel free to check out the app on GitHub (link in bio) and give it a ⭐️ if you find it interesting!

Thank you, everyone, for your constant support and encouragement. 💙🤗 Looking forward to more exciting projects ahead! 🚀✨
